# Critical Facebook API v23.0 Compatibility Fixes

## Issue Resolved
**Error**: `Campaign creation failed: (#100) Objective WEBSITE_CONVERSIONS is invalid. Use one of: OUTCOME_LEADS, OUTCOME_SALES, OUTCOME_ENGAGEMENT, OUTCOME_AWARENESS, OUTCOME_TRAFFIC, OUTCOME_APP_PROMOTION.`

## Root Cause Analysis
The error was caused by deprecated Facebook API objectives being used in the campaign creation process. The Facebook Marketing API v23.0 no longer supports old objective values like:
- `CONVERSIONS` → Now `OUTCOME_SALES`
- `REACH` → Now `OUTCOME_AWARENESS`
- `WEBSITE_CONVERSIONS` → Now `OUTCOME_SALES` or `OUTCOME_TRAFFIC`

## Files Fixed

### 1. `/app/routes/app.campaigns.create.tsx`
**Problem**: `getOptimizationGoal()` function was returning deprecated `CONVERSIONS` objective
**Solution**: 
- Changed `CONVERSIONS` to `OFFSITE_CONVERSIONS`
- Added new `getBillingEvent()` helper function
- Updated billing event mapping to use proper values

**Before**:
```typescript
case "OUTCOME_SALES":
  return "CONVERSIONS";
default:
  return "CONVERSIONS";
```

**After**:
```typescript
case "OUTCOME_SALES":
  return "OFFSITE_CONVERSIONS";
default:
  return "OFFSITE_CONVERSIONS";
```

### 2. `/app/services/ai-funnel.server.ts`
**Problem**: Hardcoded `REACH` objective in AI funnel generation
**Solution**: Updated to use `OUTCOME_AWARENESS`

**Before**:
```typescript
objective: 'REACH',
```

**After**:
```typescript
objective: 'OUTCOME_AWARENESS',
```

### 3. `/app/services/gemini.server.ts`
**Problem**: Example response contained deprecated `REACH` objective
**Solution**: Updated to use `OUTCOME_AWARENESS`

### 4. `/app/services/facebook.server.ts`
**Problem**: Fallback optimization goal was `LINK_CLICKS` (not optimal for conversions)
**Solution**: Updated to use `OFFSITE_CONVERSIONS` as default
