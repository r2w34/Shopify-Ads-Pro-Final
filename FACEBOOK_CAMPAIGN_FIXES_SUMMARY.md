# Facebook Campaign Creation Fixes - Complete Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Invalid Facebook Campaign Objectives Error
**Problem**: Campaign creation was failing with error: "Objective WEBSITE_CONVERSIONS is invalid. Use one of: OUTCOME_LEADS, OUTCOME_SALES, OUTCOME_ENGAGEMENT, OUTCOME_AWARENESS, OUTCOME_TRAFFIC, OUTCOME_APP_PROMOTION."

**Solution**: Updated all campaign objective mappings to use Facebook API v23.0 compliant objectives:
- `CONVERSIONS` → `OUTCOME_SALES`
- `LINK_CLICKS` → `OUTCOME_TRAFFIC`
- `BRAND_AWARENESS` → `OUTCOME_AWARENESS`
- `ENGAGEMENT` → `OUTCOME_ENGAGEMENT`
- Added new objectives: `OUTCOME_LEADS`, `OUTCOME_APP_PROMOTION`

### 2. Missing Media Selection and Upload
**Problem**: Campaign creation lacked media upload functionality for ad creatives.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive media selection system:
- **Media Types**: Single Image, Carousel, Video, Collection
- **File Upload**: Support for images (JPG, PNG) and videos (MP4, MOV)
- **File Validation**: Size limits and format restrictions
- **Dynamic UI**: Upload requirements change based on media type

### 3. Missing Ad Placement Options
**Problem**: No way to specify where ads should appear across Facebook's ad network.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive placement selection:
- Facebook Feed
- Instagram Feed
- Facebook Stories
- Instagram Stories
- Facebook Reels
- Instagram Reels
- Messenger
- Audience Network
